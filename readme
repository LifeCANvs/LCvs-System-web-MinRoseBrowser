NAME
	rose - Minimal browser based on webkit2gtk.

DESCRIPTION
	Rose is a basement for creating your own browser
	using the gtk and webkit libraries. Every element inside
	it is necessary for surfing, and the end-user can just add
	what he needs.

RATIONALE
	Nowadays browsers are generally full of useless
	functionalities with tons of code behind them.
	Rose has only tabs, cookies, caching and custom
	css support, but it's very hackable without any 
	special knowledge. It just has a bultin minimal 
	user interface with autohiding distracting elements.

USAGE
	We have two main files - config.h and rose.c.
	The first one is for changing settings, the second 
	for manipulating web content and gtk widgets. Just
	write your own configuration and build using make.
	rose.h is file with all yank macros etc.
	You can change global style.css in:
		~/.config/rose/style.css
	I think thats all, have a nice day!

LICENSE
	rose is released under the MIT license,
	which grants the following permissions:
	 - commercial use,
	 - distibution,
	 - modification,
	 - private usage.
